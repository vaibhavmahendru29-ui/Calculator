* Operators like `×`, `÷`, and `^` are converted into valid JavaScript syntax.
* Invalid expressions are caught and display `"INVALID OPERATION"`.

### 🚀 Future Improvements

* Add keyboard input support
* Add scientific functions (sin, cos, tan, log, etc.)
* Make the layout fully responsive for mobile screens
* Replace `eval()` with a custom expression parser
